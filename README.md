Community Plexus Org Board
=========

We searched for a transparent, open and inclussive process that would encourage the emergence of a meritocratic culture. Why we did this? Because we wanted to create the favorable conditions for the best ideas to organically rise to the surface, in the process attracting support and contributions from the community as a whole. 

See the [ZenHub board](https://github.com/ethereumbuilders/community-plexus#boards) to get an overall idea and the direction in which things are going. If you have a suggestion or idea that you think could help the community as a whole, don't be shy and share it with us by [opening a new issue on the ZenHub board]( ).
